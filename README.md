# Nail Metrics
## About
Nail_Metrics is an OpenCV based program created for experimental research in Material Science for the Mechanical Engineering Department at LSU.

## Installation
To install Nail_Metrics, simply download the files to the desired directory by clicking on "<> Code" in green near the top right, then "Download ZIP", unzip the files into the folder you want, and you will have the program along with the environment file. 

### Dependencies
Nail_Metrics uses Anaconda to handle Python and it's dependencies, which are found in environment.yml . To setup the nm-py310 Python environment, install and configure Anaconda or Miniconda. I recommend Miniconda as it does not include many unnecessary packages. Read below for instructions on how to do this.
