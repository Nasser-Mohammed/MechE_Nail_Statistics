# Nail Metrics
## About
Nail_Metrics is an OpenCV based program created for experimental research in Material Science for the Mechanical Engineering Department at LSU.

## Installation
To install Nail_Metrics, simply download this single main.py file to the desired directory. 

### Dependencies
Nail_Metrics uses Anaconda to handle Python and it's dependencies, which are found in environment.yml . To setup the nm-py310 Python environment, install and configure Anaconda or Miniconda. I recommend Miniconda as it does not include many unnecessary packages. 
#### For Windows
Follow this tutorial to install conda: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html , you can skip step 2. To open the anaconda/miniconda prompt simply search up either anaconda or miniconda (depending on which you download) in your computer's search bar and click "anaconda Powershell Prompt (Anaconda)" and replace "anaconda" with "miniconda" if you downloaded miniconda. If you made it to step 5 you are done setting up conda. If you had trouble try finding your problem on this website: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/troubleshooting/ .
